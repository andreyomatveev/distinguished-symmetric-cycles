# DistinguishedSymmetricCycles.hs #

A Haskell `DistinguishedSymmetricCycles.hs` module exporting a few
functions that describe a `(linear algebraic)-computation-free' decomposition
of a vertex of a hypercube graph with respect to its distinguished symmetric cycle. 
Based on Proposition 4.9 of the monograph [A.O. Matveev, Symmetric Cycles: 
A 2D Perspective on Higher Dimensional Discrete Hypercubes, the Power Sets
of Finite Sets, and Set Families](https://leanpub.com/SymmetricCycles), Leanpub, 2022.

## Distinguished Symmetric Cycles in Hypercube Graphs and Computation-free Vertex Decompositions ##

In order to avoid a linear algebraic technique, we use an approach to decompositions that reveals the interval structure of the negative part of the vertex, as explained in the accompanying PDF-note.
