# DistinguishedSymmetricCycles.hs

A Haskell module DistinguishedSymmetricCycles.hs exporting a couple of
functions that describe a `(linear algebraic)-computation-free' decomposition
of a vertex of a hypercube graph with respect to its distinguished symmetric cycle.

# Distinguished Symmetric Cycles in Hypercube Graphs and Computation-free Vertex Decompositions

In order to avoid a linear algebraic technique, we use an approach to finding decompositions as explained in 
an accompanying PDF-note.
