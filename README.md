# DistinguishedSymmetricCyclesModule.hs #

A Haskell `DistinguishedSymmetricCyclesModule.hs` module exporting a few
functions that describe a `(linear algebraic)-computation-free' decomposition
of a vertex of a hypercube graph with respect to its distinguished symmetric cycle. 

Based on Proposition 5.9 of the monograph [A.O. Matveev, Symmetric Cycles](https://www.routledge.com/Symmetric-Cycles/Matveev/p/book/9789814968812), Jenny Stanford Publishing, 2023.

## Distinguished Symmetric Cycles in Hypercube Graphs and Computation-free Vertex Decompositions ##

In order to avoid a linear algebraic technique, we use an approach to decomposing that reveals the interval structure of the negative part of the vertex, as explained in the accompanying PDF-note.
